This repo is a quick start for experimenting with building business applications
with Drupal prepared originally for the OSSDC conference. It is composed of a
Drush make file and installation profile directory.

build.sh can be examined for a typical build process and linking of the profile.
Once the system is built install the OSSDC profile using the standard Drupal
install process.
